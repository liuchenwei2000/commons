commons-FileUpload FileUpload 是 Apache commons下面的一个子项目，用来实现Java环境下面的文件上传功能，与常见的SmartUpload齐名。

FileUpload parses HTTP requests which conform to RFC 1867, "Form-based File Upload in HTML". 
That is, if an HTTP request is submitted using the POST method, and with a content type of "multipart/form-data", 
then FileUpload can parse that request, and make the results available in a manner easily used by the caller.
